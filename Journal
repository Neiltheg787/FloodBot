My first step of the FloodBot project was the assembly of the complete PVC frame, which will be used in the chassis. This was assembled in order to make it strong, stable, and square. Once it was assembled, I was confident that the PVC frame is flexible and will be able to accommodate the weight of the motors, batteries, electronics, and the waterproof box. This was done while keeping in mind the space that will be required later. —

Once the frame was complete, I planned the placement of the propulsion system. My design employs three bilge pump motors, mounted in the existing 1-1/4 inch openings on both sides and in the center of the frame. Each motor will be fitted with a propeller to provide thrust. This configuration allows for forward movement and steering while keeping the system balanced in water. The alignment and clearance of the motor openings were verified in order to fasten motors securely with access for maintenance.

I then had to focus on planning the electronics system and enclosure layout. The middle of the frame will be used for a waterproof case that houses all sensitive electronic pieces, such as the Raspberry Pi, microcontroller Arduino or Raspberry Pi Pico, motor driver, buck converter, and internal wiring. This is highly effective in putting all electronics in one enclosure, which will simplify waterproofing, prevent water exposure of the components, and also allow cleaner cable management. In parallel, I also researched power distribution and motor control strategies to ensure that the system operates reliably in a high-current wet environment. Voltage drops and brownouts at motor start-up under load are a major concern. Based on the research, the plan was to use one source of the battery with a DC-DC buck converter to feed a regulated 5V rail to the Raspberry Pi and microcontroller, while raw battery voltage would be forwarded directly to the motor driver. All grounds shall be shared for signal stability and to reduce electrical noise.

## Journal Entry

In this stage, I concentrated on motor mounting and electronics integration with respect to the final mechanical and electrical layout design. With the completed PVC frame, I examined the positions slated for the motors and satisfied myself that it would indeed be possible to mount the three bilge pump motors within the existing openings provided on either side and center positions on the frame using the 1-1/4 inch openings available. I also completed the design of the internal structure of the waterproof electronics enclosure. This enclosure will be placed at the center of the frame, so all the electronic devices, including the Raspberry Pi, microcontroller, motor driver, buck converter, and the wire connections inside the circuit responsible for the distribution of power, will be placed inside the enclosure.

While placing the components, I paid special attention so that the wire connections of the motors remain isolated from the logic circuitry. Further, I examined communication interfaces between the Raspberry Pi and the microcontroller and verified a control mechanism based on a serial interface to ensure proper control of the motor. This step of planning guarantees that when hardware components are obtained, implementation can be done efficiently with minimal redesigning.

During this phase, emphasis was on minimizing risk with respect to hardware installation, identifying possible difficulties with respect to mechanics, electronics, and wiring.
