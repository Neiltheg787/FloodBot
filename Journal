Started FloodBot


The FloodBot was created to be an inexpensive flood exploration robot and to learn how waterproofing, power, and robotic systems integrate. The objective is to create something useful using inexpensive materials rather than relying on expensive commercial ROV kits.


Assembled PVC Frame for FloodBot Chassis


The PVC frame for the FloodBot chassis was assembled, and care was taken to ensure that the frame was square, rigid, and strong enough to handle the weight of the motor, battery, and electronic components. After assembling the PVC frame, I determined the internal dimensions to determine the placement of the electronics box, wiring, and power system, which will help guide the design of the layout and its waterproofing.



CAD Model of Planned Motor Placement


A CAD model of the planned motor placement and waterproof electronics box placement inside the PVC frame was created. The motor placement is in existing openings in the PVC frame to maintain balance, and the center section of the frame will be used for the sealed electronics box.



Researched Power and Motor Control


Research was done regarding power and motor control to ensure stable operation in a wet and high current environment. The research focused on preventing brownouts during motor start-up and reducing electrical noise.




Switched Motor Positions and Motor Types



I modified the original CAD design to improve internal stability and water flow. I changed motor orientations and adjusted placement to improve thrust efficiency while keeping the frame balanced. These iterations helped refine the design before committing to final wiring and enclosure layouts.




Affordability Considerations



I prioritized affordability by building the frame from PVC and minimizing custom parts. I also worked with the bilge pump manufacturer and received approval for a small grant covering two motors, which reduced overall cost. Keeping the design low-cost was a key constraint throughout the project.



Created Wiring Diagram



I finalized the wiring diagram to match the intended control architecture. The Raspberry Pi handles camera streaming and high-level control, while the Arduino Uno R4 manages real-time motor control. Power is distributed using a buck converter to provide stable 5V for logic electronics and separate motor power through the motor driver. Motors are paired by side for stability, and all components share a common ground.




Final Design Review Prep

The design is complete at this point. I've sanity-checked the design with other people. The parts are pending. After that, I will assemble the electronics, make the system waterproof, and start controlled water tests. The focus is on moving the design into physical tests.
